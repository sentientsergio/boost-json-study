# Context — Boost.JSON Competitive Market Research (v0.1-scaffolding-complete)

## Purpose of this file
This file serves as a working breadcrumb trail for the AI assistant (and human collaborators) to understand exactly where we left off and what the next actions are. It is **not** a substitute for README.md, the charter, or other documentation — it focuses solely on current project state and next actionable steps.

---

## Current State (as of v0.1-scaffolding-complete)
- **Repository Structure**: Fully aligned with `01_charter/Charter.md` scaffold; all expected files exist.
- **Core Artifacts Created**:
  - Paired `.md` + `.csv` for `EvidenceLog` and `FeatureMatrix`.
  - All prompt templates in `90_prompts` (Hub, Research, Matrix, Writer, Red-Team).
  - Admin docs (`README.md` in root, CONTRIBUTING.md, PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
  - Benchmarks plan outline (`04_benchmarks/Plan.md`).
  - Placeholders for draft sections in `05_drafts/` (touched in Cursor earlier).
- **GitHub Repo**: Private repo `boost-json-study` created and contains `v0.1-scaffolding-complete` commit.

---

## Where We Left Off
1. **Scaffold Complete** — The base structure and documentation are ready for population.
2. **Not Started** — No actual research or evidence population has begun.
3. **Custom GPT Hub** — Not yet created in OpenAI’s Custom GPT builder. Needs:
   - Charter, EvidenceLog.md, FeatureMatrix.md, and prompt templates uploaded as knowledge.
   - Model set to GPT-5.
4. **Agents** — Prompts exist, but have not been tested with a real workflow.

---

## Next Steps (short-term)
1. **Decide Initial Vertical Slice**:
   - Choose a single dimension (e.g., *Standard Compliance*) and one library to research first.
2. **Run Research Agent**:
   - Populate `EvidenceLog.csv` for that dimension/library.
   - Review for evidence hygiene (G1 gate).
3. **Run Matrix Agent**:
   - Update `FeatureMatrix.csv` for that dimension across all libraries (filling only where evidence exists).
4. **Test Writer Agent**:
   - Use updated matrix + evidence to draft a small narrative section.
5. **Test Red-Team Agent**:
   - Verify the draft against matrix and evidence log.

---

## Next Steps (medium-term)
- **Create Custom GPT Project Hub** in OpenAI interface for easier agent dispatch.
- **Invite “Deep Research” agent** for breadth sweeps.
- **Decide on Benchmark Scope** (v1.0: published only; v2.0: optional local runs).
- **Begin systematic coverage** of all dimensions in FeatureMatrix.

---

## Dependencies / Open Decisions
- Awaiting confirmation of C++ standard(s), platforms, and any hard constraints from client.
- Determine if benchmarks are in v1.0 or deferred.
- Confirm workflow for syncing GitHub repo content into Custom GPT Project’s RAG context.

**Status Marker**: v0.1 — Ready for first vertical slice of research and testing of agent workflow.
