# Cursor Project Rules — Boost.JSON Competitive Market Research

## Project type

Content engineering (research synthesis). This is NOT a software development repo.

## Source of truth

- Claims originate in `02_sources/EvidenceLog.csv` (append-only).
- Comparative statements live in `03_feature_matrix/FeatureMatrix.csv`.
- Narrative lives in `05_drafts/` and must cite Evidence IDs inline as `[EVID:ID]`.

## Agent workflow

- Two modes are supported:
  - Manual ChatGPT Hub (no RAG): run Research/Matrix/Writer/Red-Team as separate chats using init blocks and runbooks.
  - AutoSlice POC (automated in Cursor): one conversation performs Research → Hygiene → Matrix → Writer → Red-Team end-to-end.
- Use the runbooks in `07_slices/` and prompts in `90_prompts/`.
- Writer and Red-Team operate strictly on FeatureMatrix + EvidenceLog subsets.

## Editing rules

- Do not invent facts; never write narrative without matching Evidence IDs.
- Do not reformat CSV headers or change column order.
- Keep `evidence_id` stable once assigned; prefer `EVID-YYYYMMDD-<dimension>-<lib>-NNN`.
- Keep quotes ≤ 25 words; avoid smart quotes in CSV.
- Prefer first-party docs over mirrors/blogs; include `method`, `source_type`, `pub_date`, and `retrieved_date`.

## Scope boundaries

- Keep performance claims in performance sections unless noted in matrix `notes`.
- If evidence is missing, leave cells blank; do not speculate.

## Commit hygiene

- Use focused commits:
  - `Evidence: <dimension> × <library>`
  - `Matrix: update <dimension> — <library>`
  - `Draft: <dimension> — update <library>`
  - `RedTeam: <dimension> — <library>`
- Do not batch unrelated changes.

## Review gates

- G1: Evidence hygiene checks before Matrix.
- G2: Matrix freeze per dimension.
- G3: Draft approved after Red-Team checklist passes.

## Automation modes

- Manual ChatGPT Hub (default):
  - Create four chats (Research, Matrix, Writer, Red-Team), paste init blocks from `90_prompts/agent_init_blocks.md`, then follow the dimension runbook in `07_slices/`.
- AutoSlice POC (optional):
  - Kickoff with `90_prompts/agent_autoslice_poc.md` (Parse Speed example). The model returns four artifacts: evidence_csv, matrix_row_csv, draft_md, redteam_md.
  - Apply outputs to the repo per the runbook `07_slices/parse_speed__autoslice_poc.runbook.md`.
