1,Streaming Support,Glaze,Glaze does not support incremental or chunked JSON parsing; it requires the full input in a contiguous buffer (typically a null-terminated string). By default, glz::opts{.null_terminated} is true; can be disabled (with slight performance cost) to accept non-null-terminated buffers,,,,Documentation,https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze/blob/main/README.md,Documentation (GitHub README),Stephen Berry,2025-08-19,2025-08-23,
2,Streaming Support,Glaze,Author notes that parsing via a file stream (feeding chunks) is typically slower than reading the entire file into memory and parsing; streaming can save RAM for extremely large files,,,,Author comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/y37pd7/new_fastest_json_library_for_c20/,Forum (Reddit),Stephen Berry (Flex_Code),2022-10-15,2025-08-23,
3,Streaming Support,Glaze,Glaze does not provide specialized coroutine or asynchronous APIs for JSON parsing; JSON read/write functions operate synchronously. (Asio HTTP streaming is transport-level, not an async JSON parser),,,,Release notes,https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze/releases/tag/v5.5.0,GitHub release,Stephen Berry,2024-06-30,2025-08-23,
4,Streaming Support,Glaze,Glaze supports partial parsing via compile-time partial_read; reads only fields that exist in the target structure and stops, skipping the remainder,,,,Documentation,https://stephenberry.github.io/glaze/partial-read/,Official docs,Stephen Berry,2024-06-04,2025-08-23,
5,Streaming Support,Glaze,On parse failure, returns error code and can format exact line/column with pointer to location,,,,Documentation,https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze/blob/main/README.md,Documentation (GitHub README),Stephen Berry,2025-08-19,2025-08-23,
6,Streaming Support,Glaze,By default, errors on unknown JSON keys; can set error_on_unknown_keys=false to skip or define unknown_read/unknown_write handlers to capture pairs,,,,Documentation,https://stephenberry.github.io/glaze/unknown-keys/,Official docs,Stephen Berry,2023-09-10,2025-08-23,
7,Streaming Support,Glaze,Designed for in-memory serialization (no intermediate DOM); reads/writes JSON directly to C++ object memory,,,,Documentation,https://github.com/stephenberry/glaze/blob/main/README.md,Documentation (GitHub README),Stephen Berry,2025-08-19,2025-08-23,
